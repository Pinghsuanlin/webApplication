Some past work on web scraping and utilization of API for data extraction and display.

* WikiAPI is to answer country and city List of related geographical Topics: I used Python, beautifulsoup, MongoDB, and WikipediaAPI to extract data from Wikipedia and deployed it on a self-built website with a search engine implemented. 
* In APIForDifferentRequest file, I connect csv file to flask API to dynamically answer different requests by pulling data from csv file.
